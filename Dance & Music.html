					musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music.
					<br><br>Dance is an art form that synchronizes rhythmic body movements with musical accompaniment. Dancers aim to express emotions and
					 communicate ideas through their physical gestures.
					<br><br>Music is often described in emotional terms. Sometimes music causes listeners to experience emotions, and other times the 
					listener may recognize an emotion without necessarily experiencing it. Either way, emotional associations are yet another way to
					 describe the style of music.
